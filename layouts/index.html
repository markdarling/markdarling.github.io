							<p>
								I'm passionate about turning complex problems into simple, scalable solutions. Currently, I lead mobile engineering efforts at Gymshark, focusing on clean architecture, observability, and transforming tech debt into opportunities for growth.
							</p>
						
							<p>
								My experience spans web development, mobile engineering, and driving business automation through AI-powered solutions. I've shipped apps, built high-performing teams, and developed tools that streamline workflows and unlock new efficiencies. Along the way, I’ve earned a reputation for bridging the gap between technical depth and business impact—always with a focus on delivering real value where it matters most.
							</p>
						
							<p>
								Whether it’s optimising mobile apps or leveraging AI to automate processes, I believe technology should enhance lives, not complicate them. Let's build smarter, not harder.
