**Have you ever wondered what it would take to bring a classic game like Snake into the 3D world? A few months ago, the answer might have involved weeks of coding, 3D modeling expertise, and deep knowledge of game development frameworks.**

But that was before. Before AI coding assistants reached their current capabilities. Before the rules of software engineering began to change right under our feet.

I just finished a proof of concept that has me questioning everything I thought I knew about the future of coding. Using nothing but AI tools, I created a rough but working 3D version of Snake—with basic enemy snakes and seasonal changes—using just a few prompts to Claude 3.7 Sonnet in a single evening (about 20 minutes of actual prompting).

The most shocking part? The entire core game emerged from a single prompt. It's rough around the edges, certainly not polished, but the fact that it works at all is what's truly remarkable.

## The Problem with Traditional Development

For years, we've operated under a simple premise: to build software, you need specialized knowledge. Deep expertise in specific languages, frameworks, and development environments. You needed to be a specialist.

This model worked because the tools available to us required this specialization. A game developer needed to understand game engines. A web developer needed to know frontend frameworks. A mobile developer needed platform-specific knowledge.

But what happens when AI can bridge these knowledge gaps instantly?

## The AI Transformation Is Happening Now

This isn't theoretical—it's already happening. My Snake project ([play it here](https://snake.markdarling.com)) stands as proof that we've entered a new era of software development.

The progression of AI tools in just the last few months has been nothing short of revolutionary. Capabilities that seemed impossible at the start of the year are now accessible with a simple conversation.

Think about that for a moment. A 3D game with basic controls, simple visuals, and fundamental game logic—all from conversing with an AI. No need to spend hours looking up Three.js documentation. No struggling with 3D mathematics. No fighting with game loop timing issues.

This changes everything.

## The New Software Engineer

If AI can handle the specialized knowledge, what does that mean for software engineers?

The future software engineer doesn't need deep knowledge of a specific technical area—they need broad knowledge of concepts and architecture, enough to guide AI to build their vision.

The skillset is shifting:

- From memorizing syntax to communicating ideas clearly
- From knowing every library function to understanding system design
- From coding expertise to problem framing expertise
- From technical depth to conceptual breadth

We're becoming architects, not brick-layers. Directors, not cameramen. We're moving up the abstraction ladder, focusing on what to build rather than how to build it.

## Broader, Not Shallower

But don't mistake this shift for a simplification. The new software engineer doesn't know less—they know differently.

They understand enough about a wide range of technologies to know what's possible. They have the architectural thinking to design systems that work across domains. They possess the communication skills to translate human needs into AI-digestible prompts.

In many ways, this requires more skill, not less. A broader perspective. A systems-thinking mindset. An ability to connect dots across traditionally separate domains.

## My Snake 3D Experience

With my Snake 3D project, I found myself operating in this new paradigm. Instead of diving deep into Three.js documentation or brushing up on 3D mathematics, I focused on what I wanted to achieve:

1. A basic 3D environment 
2. Classic Snake gameplay mechanics
3. Simple enemy snakes with rudimentary behavior
4. Seasonal visual changes

I approached Claude 3.7 Sonnet with these concepts, and through a series of conversations over about 20 minutes of prompting, we built the implementation together. The AI handled the specialized knowledge, while I directed the overall vision.

The result? A rough but functioning proof-of-concept game created in a single evening. It's not polished or production-ready by any means, but that's not the point—what matters is that it exists at all, created in a fraction of the time it would have taken through traditional development methods.

## What This Means For The Future

Software engineering as we know it has already changed. We just haven't fully acknowledged it yet.

Those who cling to the old model—deep specialization in specific technologies—may find themselves outpaced by engineers who embrace this new paradigm of AI-augmented development.

The most valuable engineers won't be those who can write the most efficient algorithm or who have memorized the most APIs. They'll be those who can envision possibilities, architect solutions, and effectively collaborate with AI to bring those solutions to life.

## Try It Yourself

The game itself is very rough—a true proof of concept built in an evening—but the implications behind it are what truly matter. This represents just the beginning of a fundamental shift in how we build software—a shift that will redefine what it means to be a software engineer in the coming years.
