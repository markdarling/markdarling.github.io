**Remember Snake? That game we all played on old Nokia phones? I wondered if I could build a 3D version of it using just AI tools. Turns out, I could.**

Last night, I spent about 20 minutes prompting Claude 3.7 Sonnet and ended up with a working 3D Snake game. It's rough, basic, and definitely not winning any design awards - but it works. And I didn't write a single line of code myself.

That's pretty wild when you think about it.

## The Problem with Traditional Development

Let's be honest about how software development usually works:

You need to know a ton of stuff before you can build anything decent. Languages, frameworks, tools, best practices - the list goes on. Want to make a game? Learn Unity or Unreal. Want a website? Better brush up on React or Angular or whatever framework is hot this week.

This creates some real problems:

- You spend more time learning than building
- Projects take forever to complete
- Only people willing to climb steep learning curves can create software
- Technical limitations often kill creative ideas

I've lost count of how many times I've thought, "I'd love to build this, but I don't know enough about X technology."

But that excuse is starting to look pretty thin.

## How AI Changes Things

My Snake project ([check it out here](https://snake.markdarling.com)) isn't impressive as a game. But it's fascinating as an example of what's becoming possible.

With just a few prompts, I got:
- A basic 3D environment
- Snake gameplay that actually works
- Some simple enemy snakes
- Different visual "seasons"

It took 20 minutes of back-and-forth with Claude. Not weeks of learning Three.js or fighting with 3D math.

I'm not claiming this is production-ready software. It's a proof of concept. But even that would have taken days or weeks before.

## What This Means for Developers

If AI can handle technical details, what happens to traditional software development?

I don't think specialists are going away. Deep technical knowledge will always be valuable. But the balance is shifting.

The developers who will thrive aren't necessarily the ones who can write the cleanest code or who know every API by heart. They'll be the ones who:

- Can explain what they want clearly
- Understand systems at a high level
- Know what's possible without knowing every implementation detail
- Can guide AI toward solving real problems

It's less about knowing exactly how to build something and more about knowing what to build in the first place.

## How I Built Snake 2025

My approach was simple:

1. I described what I wanted - a 3D Snake game with basic enemies and seasonal changes
2. I had Claude generate a working version
3. I guided it through some improvements and fixes

I didn't worry about implementation details. I didn't debug complex issues. I focused on what the game should do, not how it should do it.

The AI handled the rest. When something didn't work, I explained the problem in plain English rather than fixing code myself.

## Breaking Down Barriers

This new approach removes some major roadblocks:

- You can build stuff much faster
- You don't need years of technical training to start creating
- You can test ideas quickly without a huge investment
- The gap between idea and implementation shrinks dramatically

For the first time, the main limitation isn't "Do I know how to build this?" but "Can I explain what I want clearly enough?"

## What This Means Going Forward

Software development is changing, and it's happening faster than most people realize.

This doesn't mean everyone should fire their development team tomorrow. Complex, production-ready software still requires expertise. But the entry point is much lower, and the possibilities much broader.

The developers who adapt to this new reality - who learn to work with AI rather than compete with it - will have an enormous advantage.

## Check It Out

Want to see what a game made in 20 minutes of prompting looks like? [Play Snake 2025 here](https://snake.markdarling.com).

It's not going to win any awards. The graphics are basic. The gameplay is simple. But the fact that it exists at all - created in a single evening with just AI prompts - points to something important happening in software development.

The rules are changing. Are you paying attention?
